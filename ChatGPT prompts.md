md-slides has been created using ChatGPT 4 and Github Copilot as a coding assistant. For reference, I'm adding ChatGPT prompts here along with each commit.

## Prompt 1

### Prompt

Using javascript, html and css, can you write a web application that parses a content.md markdown file and renders its content in an interactive slides presentation? I want to be able to navigate between slides using the keyboard left and right arrows, and exit using escape. Markdown content must be interpreted as follows: heading 1 for the presentation title on the first slide; heading 2 for a section title on a dedicated slide each time; heading 3 for a page within a section, using the heading 3 text as the page title, then derive the content from the markdown content within the heading 3. Render slides with Google Roboto Slab font, centering titles in the middle of the page. Use creative commons urban architectures pictures as slide background for section pages.

### Answer

Creating a full web application to parse markdown and render it as an interactive slides presentation requires a significant amount of code. I'll provide you with a high-level outline and some sample code to help you get started, but you may need to modify and add more code to achieve your desired functionality.

- First, include the necessary libraries and styles in your HTML file: [index.html]

- Create a styles.css file with the following content: [styles.css]

- Create a slides.js file with the following content: [slides.js]

- You'll need to implement the createSlides function to handle the slide creation logic. You can use parsedHTML to...

## Prompt 2

### Prompt

Opening index.html in firefox, I now get this error: Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at file:///C:/dev/md-slides/content.md. (Reason: CORS request not http).

Can you help with that?

### Answer

Sure! The error you're encountering is due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions in modern browsers. When running your HTML file from the local filesystem (i.e., using the file:/// protocol), AJAX requests to load files like content.md will be blocked.

To resolve this issue, you can set up a simple local web server to serve your files. One easy way to do this is by using Python's built-in HTTP server. If you have Python 3 installed on your computer, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder containing your index.html file.
2. Run one of the following commands, depending on your Python version:

For Python 3.7 and later:

```
python -m http.server
```

For Python 3.4 to 3.6:

```
python3 -m http.server
```

This command will start a local web server on port 8000. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000. You should now be able to load your content.md file without encountering the CORS error.

Note that if you're using a different version of Python or don't have Python installed, you can use another local web server like the http-server package for Node.js or any other preferred web server.

In a production environment, you would deploy your application to a web server, which would handle serving the files correctly and avoid CORS issues.

### Prompt

Can you show me the way to handle that with Node.js?

### Answer

Sure! You can use the http-server package to create a local web server with Node.js. First, make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. If you haven't, you can download and install it from the official website.

Follow these steps to set up a local web server using http-server:

Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install http-server globally:

```
npm install -g http-server
```

Navigate to the folder containing your index.html file:

```
cd /path/to/your/project
```

Start the local web server by running:

```
http-server
```

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080. You should now be able to load your content.md file without encountering the CORS error.

Remember that in a production environment, you would deploy your application to a web server, which would handle serving the files correctly and avoid CORS issues.

### Prompt

ok, I still need to learn a lot apparently: now I'm getting a 404 error on GEThttp://localhost:8080/content.md. what could be the problem?

### Answer

A 404 error indicates that the requested file (in this case, content.md) was not found on the server. Here are some possible reasons for this error:

1. The content.md file is not located in the same directory as your index.html file. Make sure both files are in the same folder.
1. The file name might be misspelled or have a different case (e.g., Content.md instead of content.md). Double-check the file name and ensure it matches the name in the JavaScript code.

If you've confirmed that the content.md file is in the correct location and has the right name, there may be an issue with the http-server configuration. By default, http-server should serve all files in the specified directory without any additional configuration. However, if you're still encountering issues, you can try specifying the directory explicitly when starting the server:

```
http-server /path/to/your/project
```

Replace /path/to/your/project with the correct path to the folder containing your index.html and content.md files. Then, access the application in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:8080.

If you're still encountering issues after trying these solutions, please provide more information about your project structure and any changes you may have made to the provided code.

### Prompt

silly me, I have no local content.md file, I'll add one!

### Answer

No problem! Just create a content.md file in the same directory as your index.html file. Then, add some sample content in the Markdown format to test your application.

For example, you could use the following sample content: see [content.md]

Once you've created the content.md file and added some content, refresh your browser at http://localhost:8080. The application should now load the Markdown content and display it as interactive slides.

Remember that the provided code snippets in the previous answers are just a starting point, and you may need to modify and add more code to achieve the desired functionality fully. Make sure to implement the createSlides function and any other necessary logic for parsing and rendering the Markdown content as interactive slides.
