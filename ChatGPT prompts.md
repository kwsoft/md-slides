## Prompt 1

### Prompt

Using javascript, html and css, can you write a web application that parses a content.md markdown file and renders its content in an interactive slides presentation? I want to be able to navigate between slides using the keyboard left and right arrows, and exit using escape.

Render slides with Google Roboto Slab font, centering titles in the middle of the page. Use creative commons urban architectures pictures as slide background for section pages.

### Answer

I'll provide you with a high-level outline and some sample code to help you get started, but you may need to modify and add more code to achieve your desired functionality.

- First, include the necessary libraries and styles in your HTML file: [index.html]

- Create a styles.css file with the following content: [styles.css]

- Create a slides.js file with the following content: [slides.js]

- You'll need to implement the createSlides function to handle the slide creation logic. You can use parsedHTML to...
